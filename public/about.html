<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a designer, my primary areas of interest include visual identity, 
  editorial design, web design, and illustration. I've worked on social 
  design projects, which has given me not only professional experience in my field, 
  but also a better understanding of the positive impact of design communication 
  strategies.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Head Designer at Vets Digital, where I lead the design team 
  in creating digital and print content such as social media posts, videos, PowerPoints, 
  stands, flyers and branding.

  This position has allowed me to improve my strategic thinking, critical analysis and 
  project management, while continuing to develop my creative vision. Prior to this position, 
  I completed a master's degree in Communication Design at the Faculty of Architecture of the 
  University of Lisbon, where I developed skills in the Adobe Creative Suite, including Photoshop, 
  After Effects, Illustrator and InDesign.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have successfully carried out various projects that required creative 
  problem-solving and attention to detail. In addition, my ability to work under tight deadlines 
  while maintaining a high standard of quality has been demonstrated through various projects.</p>
